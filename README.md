# compressive-sensing

This code (CS_sinusoid.py) implements a (robust) compressive sensing (CS) scheme in which a sum of sinusoids with random amplitudes/frequencies is recovered using l_1 minimization.

For comparison purposes, this simulation also includes the Nyquist-Shannon linear sampling scheme.
